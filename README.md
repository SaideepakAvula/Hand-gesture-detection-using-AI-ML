📌 Hand Gesture Detection using AI/ML

A machine learning-based project that detects and recognizes hand gestures using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system utilizes OpenCV for real-time hand tracking, TensorFlow/PyTorch for training models, and Scikit-learn for feature extraction.

🚀 Features

✔️ Real-time hand gesture detection

✔️ Pre-trained deep learning models for classification

✔️ Supports multiple hand gestures

✔️ Can be integrated into various applications (e.g., smart home control, gaming, sign language recognition)

✔️ High accuracy using TensorFlow/PyTorch

🔧 Tech Stack Used
Programming:
Python

Libraries:

NumPy – For numerical operations

OpenCV – For image processing and real-time video capture

Scikit-learn – For ML-based feature extraction

TensorFlow / PyTorch – For deep learning model training

Mediapipe (Optional) – For efficient hand tracking

Database:

Microsoft SQL Server (if storing gesture-related data)

📜 How It Works?

Captures real-time video feed using OpenCV.

Detects hands using deep learning models.

Classifies gestures based on trained models.

Outputs the recognized gesture in real-time.

📌 Future Enhancements

🔹 Add gesture-based controls for smart devices

🔹 Improve accuracy with more training data

🔹 Deploy as a web-based or mobile application
